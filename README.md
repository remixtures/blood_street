// Short Intro

A web app developed in 24 hours for Academia de CÃ³digo's hackathon that took place one week before the end of the bootcamp.

// The Idea

All the participating groups were given a randomly chosen song to develop a web app inspired by it in one day. Our group got "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" by the BackStreet Boys. After watching the song's videoclip, we did a small brainstorming session in order to gather the most appealing ideas for an app remotely related with the clip. We opted for building an app based on a fantasy universe where vampires roam across the earth and they need blood to feed themselves. Hence the opportunity of connecting voluntary blood donors with vampires while also potentially making the bridge with the real world - ie, location of blood banks.

// The Development

We started by making a diagram of the core classes that we would need ("suckers" and "donors"), including their properties and methods. We took inspiration from Academia's own Javabank MVC architecture for the remaining classes and respective packages and adapted to our project's requirements. Given the short time frame, we opted for a front-end framework - Bootstrap -, from which we picked a template and customized its HTML and CSS. As an added feature, we included geolocation referencing via Google Maps API. The localization of the donors was specifically signaled so that vampires. Our biggest hurdle came when we tried to implement Thymeleaf as a Java template engine for serving HTML files. Despite some hiccups, we were able to successfully reach our goal and ended up in third place among a set of seven teams.

// My Role
I provided all the site's content, including the donors' profiles and their blood reviews by the vampires. I also gave some help in the implementation of agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban).

// Technologies
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, Google Maps API, Apache Tomcat, MySQL, Git, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, Mac Os X, IntelliJ Idea.
